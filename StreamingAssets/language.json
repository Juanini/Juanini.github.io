    "Intro1": "Welcome to the Academy of Magicians called: Wizardgraph!",
    "Intro2": "A place where prestigious magicians have learned the art of graphics secrets and have been able to analyze the world and its behavior.",
    "Intro3": "Only people with an incredible sense of analysis can access this course, feel happy because you are one of them!",
    "Intro4": "The graphs associate data that is called variables.",
    "Intro5": "The graphs are conformed by two axis, the X axis and the Y axis.",
    "Intro6": "The numbers start from the point of intersection of the X axis and the Y axis.",
    "Intro7": "The points are the result of the intersection between the X variable and the Y variable.",
    "Intro8": "When a variable is equal to 0, the intersection occurs in one of the axis.",
    "Intro9": "Let's graph all the data points!",
    "Intro10": "Once all the points are graphed, a line, called slope, that passes aproximately through the center of the points has to be made.",
    "Intro11": "The slope of the line is approximate and is interpreted as an exchange rate.",
    "Intro12": "The exchange rate can be calculated with the following formula.",
    "Intro13": "Where the m means the change in the Y variable, along with the change in the X variable.",
    "Intro14": "The b means the intersection of the slope along the Y axis.",
    "Intro15": "The line of best fit helps us to predict data.",
    "Intro16": "In this graph we will apply the line of best fit formula.",
    "Intro17": "We will select two points that cross the line of best fit and we will apply the formula.",
    "Intro18": "The result in this case, means that a rabbit that was born with a weight of 1kg will increase 0.66kg each year.",
