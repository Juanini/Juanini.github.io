  "INTRO_VIDEO_1":"The sun provides energy through its light! Plants use that energy through photosynthesis, like this bush and tree.",
  "INTRO_VIDEO_2":"Plants are producers.They produce their own food! They also make food for other living things. Like this apple tree.",
  "INTRO_VIDEO_3":"Animals are consumers, they cannot make their own food, they eat. Primary consumers are herbivores, that means they can only eat plants, like this rabbit.",
  "INTRO_VIDEO_4":"Secondary consumers eat meat but can also be omnivorous, that means they can eat meat and plants, like this fox.",
  "INTRO_VIDEO_4.5":"Apex Predators are at the top of the food chain! They don't have a natural predator. Like humans!",
  "INTRO_VIDEO_5":"Decomposers, like this mushroom, takes energy decomposing organic materials like remains of the apple. This happens at any level of the food chain.",
  "INTRO_VIDEO_6":"Together, plants and animals create a food chain! There must be a quantity of each living thing that participates in the food chain to keep the ecosystem balanced!"
